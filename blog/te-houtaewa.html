    <h1>Have You Read Any Good Blogs Lately?</h1>
    
    <h3>27 June 2022</h3>
    <h2>I introduced myself to the DEVA cohorts and started the Sprint 2 activities.</h2>
    <p>
      Today, I got up when it was still dark to take a 2 hour meeting with a collaborator in Canada.  We are collaborating on a game community discord.  We had a good catch up and created action items and deadlines.  I think he's kinda shocked that I asked questions, showed him some analysis I did and tried to educate him on good discord hygiene because he kinda made the discord a "dog's breakfast".  I've been doing design work to grow the community and practice other skills. The other collaborator is a 30 something family man and gamer. Super smart and capable.  Charismatic and nice. I like him and I think he trusts my discretion.  He definitely trusts my discord skills. And I hope we make something wonderful so I can put that on my cv.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I had my cup of coffee and wrote an introduction about myself for the DEVA foundation discord channel.  This was an activity as part of the first sprint, but I waited to do it today while I was fresh.  I basically gave an intro about myself, some values I live by and why I'm doing this DEVA full stack course.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This sprint, I decided to read everything first before starting the work to understand:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What I was tasked to do this week.</li>
      <li>What files and set up I needed to do.</li>
      <li>Where was the online service to read up on the coding syntax.</li>
      <li>Ask any questions.</li>
      <li>Verify anything before I got stick in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So the first thing that is rolling in my mind is 'What blogs do I read?','Why do I read them?', 'Who reads blogs these days?'  I am far more comfortable with podcasts and VLOGs.  But am I willing to do that?  ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I find that I just got alot to say and sometimes uncomfortable sharing my opinions more because the internet climate is unkind to folks, especially middle aged women.  However, it's good to put this learning thoughts down for future revisits.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with an open mind, I jump into the fray of uncomfortable sharing and see what I come up with.
