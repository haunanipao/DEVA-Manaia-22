          <summary>Foundation Reflections 
            <p class="date">18 - 22 July 2022 / Sprint 5 / Core</p>  
          </summary>
            <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                I can do programming on this level, so far. I am not a skilled programmer. I am able to talk with other people and see what motivates them to do this program and do my best to be supportive when they are being hard on themselves. I can allow myself a growth mindset and deal with not doing everything perfectly but doing them in a way that helps me to be effective.
              </p>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                I’m not sure what is meant by “surprised”.  Because I have worked in situations where these types of skills are part of the job, learning to listen to another and reflect what they said is part of the job, but also great for working on teams. The fact that DEVA teaches these skills to those with a critical role offers us a way to collaborate and deal with challenging situations with people. People are always the hardest part of tech, from the reasons to make a thing to  trying to get people to click on the CTA of a thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason I think it’s important to discuss is because the NZ tech scene as much as it is full of amazing people, not all tech situations are “capable to deal” with things that affect how we work with stress and commitments to meet market deadlines. Depending on the work domain, the mindset feels old.  There are company behaviours and decisions that do not seem to foster an environment for core skills or honest conversations. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I think you spend some time learning core skills because you know that the industry in general, can feel harsh when it comes to folks that are career switching during this time of uncertainty in this world.  This gives us communication skills to manage that harshness with some kindness, something sorely needed in the world right now. And that’s because, people. People are always harder than technology.  So have some empathy for yourself as well as other folks.
              </p>

            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? Is it a waste of time? Should focused on practise programming instead?</h3>
              <p>
                I encourage DEVA to ask open-ended questions.  It sounds like you’re not sure why you offer core skills when it is probably DEVA's biggest value proposition as it helps folks deal with their personal discomfort in being vulnerable while learning something new. Because in this industry, you will always be learning and applying those learnings to work situations. And you will encounter work situations that test your resolve and confidence. So using tangible ways to manage human skills effectively is a good thing. 
              </p>

              <p>
                But, no, this is not a waste of time to practice good human skills because it will be those skills that can make you an effective programmer that works with other folks to make a thing.  Perhaps it will help you manage opportunities that meet your values so that you find work that is satisfying, that earns an income for you and your family and just maybe, does good in this world.

          <summary>Learning Plan, part deux
            <p class="date">18 - 22 July 2022 / Sprint 5 / Core</p>  
          </summary>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
              <p>
                I'd like to be a better designer by learning programming. I'd like to have better conversations with other makers in the tech industry. I'm keen for gigs in the disruptive blockchain industry because I think it's interesting but uncomfortable work. I'm also keen on the gaming industry or opportunities that engage their communities. I'd like to work in design and development freelance opportunities.</p>
              <p>
                I'd like to do remote / hybrid work. I'd like to continue to be a woman in tech because I find the work interesting. The tech industries need diversity like me to create products for all types of folks
              </p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
              <p>
                My strengths in bootcamp is that I’m collaborative with folks to get their point of view in a conversation.  I like to do research as part of my learning process.  It allows me to see commonalities in solution design to think about in my thoughts.  
              </p>
              <p>
                In Bootcamp, my biggest challenge is managing time because it is a fuller commitment compared to Foundations.  I felt that this was a challenge for me because I was allowing other things to distract me and it’s something I want to tackle better.  My initial thoughts are to manage it better through timeboxing activities and communicating change of my availability to “non bootcamp” activities.   I welcome help to overcome my  issues on TIME.
              </p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
              <p>
                My biggest non-technical challenge is finding the sweet spot between wanting to do my best and the time allowed to do it.  I don’t want to get too precious about that, but I do hope to improve as I grow my skills and knowledge, but with the online situation, I need to overcome my distractions so I can power through this. 
              </p>
             
            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
              <p>
                I would love to talk to others about their experiences in mastering these skills in general.  Mostly because I’m curious about the types of things they encounter that are challenging and how they overcome it and how I can apply those learnings to my situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also want to get comfortable at not knowing it all and asking for help while offering help with the values I can offer. So learning all the new faces and why to go to them is something to practice.  I really want Bootcamp to be valuable to my learning and growing my community.
              </p>
            <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
              <p>
                Pretty much similar to what I wrote about my expectations for the foundation team.  I would love to work on feedback that helps me overcome insecurities and improve my capability.  
              </p>
              <p>
                To recap those expectations: I tend to communicate daily with a simple salutation, so you know I'm alive. If I need help or advice, I will ask and share. If I need to inform the facilitator of something private, I'll DM. If something I am doing has a time blocker, I'll let the faciliator know with a deadline and outcome. If it's advice I can get from others, I'll use other conversation paths for collaboration. If it's serious stuff that requires talking with the more business end of DEVA, I'll go to email or pick up the phone to the adminstrative staffs. I like honest, open, kind conversations. I like to laugh as well. I am accountable for my mistakes because I make alot of them.

          <summary> The Problems with Solving

            <h3>This one time, at Github camp</h3>
              <p>
                 I couldn’t figure out how to send a branch that I created on my machine back up to the fork on github for a pull request.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me backup a bit.  The task was visiting a forked version of the Zen Garden HTML from Dave Shea and getting “Kiwi with it” for a bit of a tidy up to best practices. This activity was to reaffirm hygienic coding practices to support good outcomes of readability, editing and problem solving of web page assets.  Most importantly, this is a skill that is required to be a respectful developer on a team with other folks that code.  
              </p>
              <p>
                So I was pretty happy to see that Zen Garden still had a role to teach us to be tidy and clean up our act.  That was the easy bit.  The harder bit was trying to move that work up to Github to my fork for a pull request.  When I:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>⭐use the simplistic “Git Add…” and “Git Commit…” which doesn't help in this situation.</li>
                <li>⭐didn’t see the file up on Github to do the pull request</li>
                <li>⭐didn’t see a strong call to action on what to do next.</li>
                <li>⭐I pinged the Homegroup for advice and was in waiting mode.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I kinda didn’t know what was going on because I’m not Github savvy and I think some parts of it need help to inform me what I’ve done and what my possible next steps could be from that action.  For example, the last step I did on Github was to fork a repo.  On the fork page in my profile perhaps there could be next action calls to action or questions for next steps such as: 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>⭐did you branch your fork?  Remember, we won’t see new commits unless you use this code “Git Add - A Git Commit - m… to push your branch upstream.</li>
                <li>⭐is there a way that Github keeps track of your orphan files and notifies you when it finds something?</li>
              </ul>
              <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/sprint4-asking-for-help.png" alt="Stuck? Ask for help!" height="700px">
        
              <p>
                I moved on to something else, while I waited to hear back and got stuck into other stuff.  So fast forward to the end of the day and I saw that another in my homegroup successfully did a tidy pull request and I reached out and asked him questions of what he did and he put me on the right track because I forgot what to do and didn’t read the directions.  It was tremendously helpful to talk with another. :)
              </p>
              <p>
                Key thing I learned from this experience is to read the instructions a few more times to make sure I understood the github steps instead of just doing the simple “Git Add/Git Commit” actions.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, I got some nice folks in my homegroup.  I appreciate them.
                
              </p>

              <h4>Side Note</h4>
              <p>
                I have known the Zen Garden website for 2 decades, I was a fan of it in my early web designer days.  Mostly because our web products had page layouts that used tables, yes, the horrid tables, which was a big thing in the Web 1 days.  I was learning XHTML and CSS and using Zen Garden to understand how to do that better and suggested that we change our approach to web pages.
              </p>
              <h3>My Kata Journey</h3>
              <p>
                So I’ve been enjoying these Kata in the Replit browser tool (link).  I like that it’s just focused on the JS and it’s a holistic tool that is all in one for coding and viewing outcomes.  Unlike the vscode experience of coding in the vscode and test / validation in chrome developer tools.  I have a sneaky suspicion that there is a way to view all the work in vscode, I just haven’t explored to find out how, mostly to follow the curriculum. Sometimes, there’s value in doing things the “hard way” to gain perspective of the complexity in skillset. It helps you to recognise a better way and appreciate an ideal.
              </p>
              <p>
                So this Replit is really nice for this part of the learning journey and the Kata have been great for practising my JS skills because each one focuses on a topic and then gets progressively more challenging as we unpack the learnings from our “wax on/ wax off” exercises.  
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing I took advantage of was a session with Jo$eph as an introduction to Katas on Replit.  Going through that session helped me understand the process to do this task:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>⭐an introduction to how the files are organised in the DEVA Repls (their branding for Repos).</li>
                <li>⭐do research on key points and leverage solutions that have come before.</li>
                <li>⭐approach solution incrementally, starting with console.log().</li>
                <li>⭐break big things into smaller thing.s</li>
                <li>⭐unpack error message to determine next steps.</li>
                <li>⭐view the solution critically and find pathways of efficiency and improvement.</li>
                <li>⭐discuss the solution and ask questions.</li>
              </ul>
              <!--p>

              <p>
                The last Kata was working with Array Methods and I coded half of them confidently on my own, but the last two tickled the grey matter a bit more.  So I started checking out the discord to see if any others were having the same tickling.  And mostly to see if I was in the same general area with other folks on problems and solutions.  
              </p>
              
              <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/my-kata-journey.png" alt="My Kata Journey" title="My Kata Journey with Problem Solving" width="80%" height="80%">
              <p>Some lessons learned from the experience:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>⭐take the pseudocode from the hints and look at what was suggested.</li>
                  <li>⭐leverage learnings from previous successful Katas.</li>
                  <li>⭐made time for research by googling websites besides MDN to understand what the Array method does and the syntax for how it’s used.</li>
                  <li>⭐I watched youtube videos that were short and sweet because I wanted to understand how it was used in situations.  I’ve learned that my reading and comprehension is sometimes not that good to how the directions are expressed.  I mean..it’s a fine line between giving hints to success without giving the answer away.=.  </li>
                  <li>⭐being a designer, I still like to use pencil and paper to write code examples out.  Mostly to enjoy that kinetic energy of scratching out notes from what I know.</li>
                  <li>⭐use the Replit to code up an approach and console logging to see how the code performed in the Kata.</li>
                  <li>⭐try different solutions that give the same outcome and iterate the code to refine it.</li>
                  <li>⭐remember to remove your console.log() crutch when your code looks right.</li>
                </ul>
              <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
              <p>
                During this sprint, I found myself bookmarking more pages, signing up for more web services related to coding, and watching more youtube to gather "JIT" information needed for problem solving these Katas.  I was consuming spots of different sources and structuring the knowledge into a "problem solving" cadence that made sense to me to do the tasks.  
              </p>
              <p>
                My "designer" sense tells me that this research practice is normal as I gain confidence in my programming skills because it doesn't feel intuitive yet. But something in the process of getting started, focusing on the problem, applying steps to solve the problem, and understanding how to deal with errors does feel more reasonable.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was reminded of some Hawaiian wisdom back in my hula days when we would use different sources of history and knowledge to understand the underlying story of a song and how to interpret it for meaningful dance moves in storytelling for others to enjoy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those same novice feelings of inadequancy, of not knowing what makes sense and how to proceed respectfully, reminded me of that wisdom that I want to share:  
              </p>
              <h4>'A`ohe pau ka 'ike i ka hālau ho`okāhi:  All knowledge is not taught in the same school.</h4>
              <p>
                One can learn from many sources. We shouldn't act superior when it comes to knowledge.  There is value from all resources and not all knowledge is the same.
              </p>

            <h3>World of Mindful Chatting</h3>
              <p>
                I had a chance to talk with a young man who I found out through our encounter, had some things in common with me. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We had a ‘get to know you’ conversation and by just sharing typical information that is asked of all of us when we meet someone new. And in the sharing of our stories, we practised mindful listening.  We didn’t talk about the questions given to us as much as we talked about our lives in NZ and found that we had commonalities that brought us to participate in the DEVA program.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re both immigrants that have made this our home for over a decade.  He came from the UK and I came from the US.  He came with his family as a teenager and I came to make a my family with my kiwi love. We're creative folks and worked in jobs that helped us practice design.  He taught design in tertiary education. I worked in the tech industry as a designer.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s working in a design role in companies that didn’t seem to value the work we did.  We shared stories of working long hours for a paycheck that didn’t grow as much as the job responsibilities did.  How that lack of opportunity and financial growth impacts personal life decisions of love, life and happiness in New Zealand.  
              </p>
              <p>
                And that’s why we are at Dev Academy.  DEVA is an opportunity to grow skills that complement our knowledge and open opportunities in things we are interested in.  We shared some tips we learned from others in our homegroups and some cool websites to use to help us learn how to program as well as some other stuff.  It was nice to have so many of the same interests with another in this program.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, did we practice mindful listening?  Yup.  Did we ask each other all those questions about our personal growth in foundations? Sort of. Did we enjoy chatting with each other? Hell yeah.

            <h3>The Story</h3>
              <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/sprint3-JS-cocktail.png" alt="Drawn by Haunani Pao inspired by her silly story." width="400px">
              <p>
                Feeling festive one night, HTML, CSS and JS walked into a bar with the goal of trying 10 drinks of their own creation. To start, HTML ordered a short, glass tumbler with ice, CSS ordered the spirit of gin, a mixer of aromatic tonic water, a slice of lemon and melon ball skewered by the toothpick on a colourful paper umbrella, JS ordered a straw and used it to sip the Gin and Tonic and described to HTML and CSS how the drink creation tasted and what could be different on the next drink flavour.  As the night moved on, HTML and CSS ordered various glass tumblers with various liquids with different food types and umbrella accoutrements.  
              </p>
              <p>
                JS continued to sample the concoctions and relay their thoughts to HTML and CSS.  JS kept track of the drink count by nibbling on the fruit and then placing the paper umbrella in their hair to signal they were done with a drink and ready for a new creation. And when they reached the drink count of 10 with 10 paper umbrellas in their hair, JS switched to water, continuing to caucus with HTML and CSS over their drink experiment. As the festivities ended, HTML and CSS guided an umbrella bedecked JS to their home, where all of them tucked themselves into bed for a sleep full of spirited and colourful dreams.  
              </p>
            <h3>And now the rest of the story</h3>
              <p>
                So, this little story talks about the things I learned about in Sprint 3 of DEVA. It was our first foray into JavaScript and there is a lot to take in and think about as I’m still a JS newbie.  However, if I was to sum things up:
              </p>
              <p>
                HTML is the structured content on a web page such as Text on “paper”.
                CSS specifies how that content is laid out, how it looks, and how it looks on different devices.
                JS is behaviour expressed via user choices on page elements. This is the part that helps you interact with the content on a webpage and makes it feel interesting.  To do this, JS needs to talk with the DOM or Document Object Model.
              </p>
              <p>
                The DOM reflects the structure of the HTML page by offering pathways the JS can traverse and interact with and change things on a webpage, temporarily or permanently. To interact with the DOM, JS is organised so the code statements are ordered from top to bottom for execution until it encounters conditional or loop structures.
              </p>
              <p>
                These statements are usually represented by variables, data types, functions and iterative “travelling loops” that logically go through the DOM and execute actions upon DOM elements. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Functions are little bits of logic structured in code statements to form an executable action on the HTML or CSS. They can use the DOM elements to do something such as find areas on the page of a type and add text, change things or do a calculation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The travelling ‘for’ loop takes an initial state of a condition, does something for as long as the condition is true, and goes up (or down) by a number, for as long as the conditional is true. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Variables are used by functions to aid with the execution of it.  They can be prolific in type, some are simple of just one thing, some are more complex with a series of things together. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Arrays are an ordered list of values that can be accessed starting with the first item in the array at position 0.  They can have different elements of numbers, strings and booleans. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Objects are entities that can hold different collections of data types and properties unique to that object, making it one of the more complex JS data entities.  Objects can have properties that include other objects. 
              </p>
            <h3>And this is the end of my story</h3>
              <p>
                Ok, so I enjoyed playing with JavaScript, but it sometimes did my head in and I can only surmise that I must interact with JS on “the daily” basis to really really understand its power in the HTML/CSS/JS universe.  As my mantra is “Practice Make Permanent” and so I must practice on.

          <summary>Emotional Intelligence - Turning it up to 11!
            <p class="date">
              4 - 8 July 2022 / Sprint 3 / Core
            </p>              
          </summary>
            <p>
              I’m trying to remember when I first heard about “Emotional Intelligence” or “EQ” as a way to describe interpersonal skills to engage in meaningful conversations within challenging situations or new contexts.  These techniques are non threatening, open and collaborative.
            </p>  
            <p>
              The most typical form of EQ is active listening and reflections.  Now, some folks label this as “Conscious Listening” and I think that’s reasonable. I use “Active” because it describes my engagement with another person.  This is focusing on the speaker, looking at them and listening to what they say as they describe a situation and the context of how they felt within it.  I use active sounds of “hmm” “mmm hmm” as verbal punctuations so they understand that I’m paying attention but won’t interrupt them.  After a few minutes when the speaker gets to the end of their point and pauses, I may use phrases of reflection such as “From what you said, I heard…and you felt … Did I hear that right?”  Therefore inviting more conversation, clarification and connection (aka the 3 Cs).
            </p>           
            <p>
              As a UX designer, I use these skills professionally to engage people to gather information about something they know about. I use it when I’m testing a concept on a test participant. But mostly, I just use it to talk with folks and catch up with them.
            </p>               
            <p>
              Generationally, I heard the “EQ” label as a signal from young people to describe themselves or others when dealing with people.  They use phrases such as “So-n-so has a great EQ when it comes to difficult situations about …” or “My partner was having a hard day last night and I just “put on my EQ hat” and just listened to them.”  It feels a little situational in that context but I felt it was a way for them to say that “I use these skills to deal with overwhelming situations of adulthood with personal responsibility and empathy.”
            </p> 
            <p>
              And I appreciate that thoughtful approach, because I certainly didn’t understand these concepts when I was a young person starting out in the tech industry.  I’m not sure we actually had a word to describe this type of intelligence. But in the 21st century, exercising EQ skills feels normal for successful work and professional relationships.

          <summary>Is Figma Auto Layout the gate way drug to CSS Flexbox?
            <p class="date">
              27 June - 1 July 2022 / Sprint 2 / Tech
            </p> 
          </summary> <br>
          <h3>I fell down the rabbit hole</h3>
            <p>
              It's possible that I was thinking this part of the course would seem familiar to me. Because CSS is how the webpage looks and I may have dabbled in that in the past.  I traversed the lessons of watching the training videos and answering questions and it all seemed reasonable.  And then it got interesting with layouts with GRID.    
            </p>
            <p>
              It was then, when I fell down the Flexbox hole because I really enjoyed playing with the Flexbox. It reminded me of Figma Design tool which is a tool I use to design a webpage using the <strong>Auto Layout</strong> feature.  It felt familar to: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>⭐ set areas on the page for header, main and footer.</li>
              <li>⭐ add content items for each area,</li>
              <li>⭐ use features of auto layout to decide how the items would flow on a page.</li>
            </ul>      
            <h3>Setting Direction</h3>
              <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-flex-gap.png" alt="Figma's Auto Layout">
              <p>
                With Figma Auto Layout, I can set the direction of the items horizontally or vertically, just like flex-direction can be rows or column.  But Figma Auto Layout does not do the row-reverse or column reverse.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can set the gap between items as well as padding horizontally and vertically. In Flexbox I've only managed to set gaps between items so far.
              </p>
            <h3>Alignment of items</h3>
              <p>
                I find aligning items rather fundamental for layouts.
              </p>
              <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-flex-justify-content.png" alt="Jusify Content">
              <p>
                With Figma Auto Layout, I can set the items alignment in 9 different ways.  With Flexbox, I use justify-content and align-items to specify how I want to put items in the space.  I do appreciate how easy it is to specify in Flexbox.
              </p>
            <h3>Advance Layout for spacing items</h3>
              <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-advanced-layout.png" alt="Packed">
              <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-advanced-layout-space-between.png" alt="Space Between">
              <p>
                In Flexbox, there's quite a few options for setting item space.  You can use space-between, which give equal space between items on the page.  I found in Figma's Auto Layout, the options to set space between items or keep them packed closely.  Flexbox allows items to have space-around items, which I'm not sure I found something equal in Figma.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'll pick this up later as I have more time with Flexbox and making web pages.

          <h3>What is my long term goals or career pathways</h3>
            <p>
              I'd like to be a better designer by learning programming. I'd like to have better conversations with other makers in the tech industry.  I'm keen for gigs in the disruptive blockchain industry because I think it's interesting but uncomfortable work.  I'm also keen on the gaming industry or opportunities that engage their communities.  I'd like to work in design and development freelance opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'd like to do remote / hybrid work. I'd like to continue to be a woman in tech because I find the work interesting. The tech industries need diversity like me to create products for all types of folks.
            </p>
          <h3>What are my strengths?</h3>
            <p>
              My strengths are that I have experience and knowledge to see the patterns of creating tech products as our humanity grows their expectations. I know user experience design, user research and have a knack to see "the gorilla in the room" while other people focus on the things that matter to them.  I'm a kind, curious and direct person. I'm a "work in progress", however, I will communicate if something comes up. 
            </p>
          <h3>What are my limitations?</h3>
            <p>
                My confidence has waned in the NZ tech market because it feels "behind" in practice. I'm concerned about the changes in Covid and the world. It makes me avoid things if it harms me and my family. So it keeps me from wanting to engage face to face over a coffee.  I want to change things up so I can get back out there with confidence.
            </p>
          <h3>What skills do I want to develop?</h3>
            <p>
              I want to learn tech skills that let me share my creativity on my own website so others will want to work with me. 
            </p>
          <h3>How will I manage my workload in the programme of learning?</h3>
            <p>
              I have put other things to the side and focused on this because it's important to me and my family. However, I sometimes need a break and will take a break so that the other life things aren't ignored. I learn by doing. I don't want to worry that I'm not smart enough or good enough. Because learning coding skills takes time to grow, by doing the work, not by being perfect. 
            </p>
            <p>
               "Practice Makes Permanent!" is what I say to myself as I make this journey into web development.
            </p>
          <h3>What do I expect from the Faciliation Team</h3>
            <p>
             I tend to communicate daily with a simple salutation, so you know I'm alive.  If I need help or advice, I will ask and share.  If I need to inform the facilitator of something private, I'll DM.  If something I am doing has a time blocker, I'll let the faciliator know with a deadline and outcome. If it's advice I can get from others, I'll use other conversation paths for collaboration.  
            </p>
            <p>
              If it's serious stuff that requires talking with the more business end of DEVA, I'll go to email or pick up the phone to the adminstrative staffs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like honest, open, kind conversations.  I like to laugh as well. I am accountable for my mistakes because I make alot of them.

            <h3>Hi, my name is Haunani Pao</h3>
            <p>
              Haunani is Hawaiian (ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi) which means "beautiful snow". <a href ="https://forvo.com/word/haunani/" target="_blank">Here's how you say it</a> My mother gave me this middle name because I was born in California in the northern hemisphere's wintertime. You can call me by my nickname, 'Nani', because it’s easier to remember and who doesn't like to be called 'beautiful' everyday? 😜
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and that has a huge impact on how I see the world and how I interact with people because I've always been surrounded by human diversity that categorises what it's like to be "American" as well as that tech world of ideas and art. I immigrated to Aotearoa in 2010 because I fell in love with a Kiwi man who ticks all the boxes for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Professionally I have worked in UX Design for the past 20 years (in both America and Aotearoa), however, most folks in the Auckland Tech Scene know me as the main organiser for UX Auckland and I can be found, most likely, talking with folks about the design work that impacts us on the daily as well as mentoring folks on their career journey.  Like many women in these Covid times, I was part of the 99% that “lost” their job which allowed me the privilege to take a break from “chasing the paycheck” and focusing on the stuff I’m interested in as a Researcher, Mentor, Freelance UX Designer, Curious Creator of Art, Gamer and Speaker.
            </p>                      
            <p>
              With that said, I’d like to leverage values that I crafted for UXA because they still hold true for my approach to life as an Amerikiwi woman who has made a home in a fabulous place on earth:
            </p>
            <h4>Kindness First!</h4>
              <p>
                We call Aotearoa our home.  We’re Just Another Fabulous Accent. We think diverse points of view make for better outcomes.  We challenge our bias through warm and friendly conversations.   We value inclusivity, kindness and respect.
              </p>
              <h4>Be generous with your mana.</h4>
              <p>
                We think everyone is smart and capable.  When two or more of us get together, we co-create and share learnings so "no one grows alone".
              </p> 
              <h4>Go HAM!</h4>
              <p>
                We find the sparks of inspiration, explore and learn from mistakes. 
                Go Hard Always Mate!
              </p> 
              <h3>So why am I doing Dev Academy?</h3>
              <p>
                I’m so fortunate to have met and worked with Dev Academy Alumni. They inspired me to take this opportunity in the 👉🏽“I do what I want” world tour 👈🏽.  I’ve been spending the past few months researching and unpacking Blockchains, Crypto and NFTs and I want to learn how to code so I can see what ideas spring from my noggin but mostly improve my skills.  As my husband told me, “gain the skills to pay the bills”. My hope is that this will make me a better designer, but also open up work opportunities in the burgeoning blockchain domain.  Because they need folks like me.
