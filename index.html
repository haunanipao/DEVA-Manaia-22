            <summary>HTML, CSS and JavaScript walked into a bar... 
              <p class="date">
                4 - 8 July 2022 / Sprint 3 / Tech

              <h3>The Story</h3>
                <p>
                  Feeling festive one night, HTML, CSS and JS walked into a bar with the goal of trying 10 drinks of their own creation. To start, HTML ordered a short, glass tumbler with ice, CSS ordered the spirit of gin, a mixer of aromatic tonic water, a slice of lemon and melon ball skewered by the toothpick on a colourful paper umbrella, JS ordered a straw and used it to sip the Gin and Tonic and described to HTML and CSS how the drink creation tasted and what could be different on the next drink flavour.  As the night moved on, HTML and CSS ordered various glass tumblers with various liquids with different food types and umbrella accoutrements.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  JS continued to sample the concoctions and relay their thoughts to HTML and CSS.  JS kept track of the drink count by nibbling on the fruit and then placing the paper umbrella in their hair to signal they were done with a drink and ready for a new creation. And when they reached the drink count of 10 with 10 paper umbrellas in their hair, JS switched to water, continuing to caucus with HTML and CSS over their drink experiment. As the festivities ended, HTML and CSS guided an umbrella bedecked JS to their home, where all of them tucked themselves into bed for a sleep full of spirited and colourful dreams.  
                </p>
              <h3>And now the rest of the story</h3>
                <p>
                  So, this little story talks about the things I learned about in Sprint 3 of DEVA. It was our first foray into JavaScript and there is a lot to take in and think about as I’m still a JS newbie.  However, if I was to sum things up:
                </p>
                <p>
                  HTML is the structured content on a web page such as Text on “paper”.
                  CSS specifies how that content is laid out, how it looks, and how it looks on different devices.
                  JS is behaviour expressed via user choices on page elements. This is the part that helps you interact with the content on a webpage and makes it feel interesting.  To do this, JS needs to talk with the DOM or Document Object Model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The DOM reflects the structure of the HTML page by offering pathways the JS can traverse and interact with and change things on a webpage, temporarily or permanently. To interact with the DOM, JS is organised so the code statements are ordered from top to bottom for execution until it encounters conditional or loop structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These statements are usually represented by variables, data types, functions and iterative “travelling loops” that logically go through the DOM and execute actions upon DOM elements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Functions are little bits of logic structured in code statements to form an executable action on the HTML or CSS. They can use the DOM elements to do something such as find areas on the page of a type and add text, change things or do a calculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The travelling ‘for’ loop takes an initial state of a condition, does something for as long as the condition is true, and goes up (or down) by a number, for as long as the conditional is true. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Variables are used by functions to aid with the execution of it.  They can be prolific in type, some are simple of just one thing, some are more complex with a series of things together. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arrays are an ordered list of values that can be accessed starting with the first item in the array at position 0.  They can have different elements of numbers, strings and booleans. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Objects are entities that can hold different collections of data types and properties unique to that object, making it one of the more complex JS data entities.  Objects can have properties that include other objects. 
                </p>
              <h3>And this is the end of my story</h3>
                <p>
                  Ok, so I enjoyed playing with JavaScript, but it sometimes did my head in and I can only surmise that I must interact with JS on “the daily” basis to really really understand its power in the HTML/CSS/JS universe.  As my mantra is “Practice Make Permanent” and so I must practice on.

            <summary>Emotional Intelligence - Turning it up to 11!
              <p class="date">
                4 - 8 July 2022 / Sprint 3 / Core
              </p>              
            </summary>
              <p>
                I’m trying to remember when I first heard about “Emotional Intelligence” or “EQ” as a way to describe interpersonal skills to engage in meaningful conversations within challenging situations or new contexts.  These techniques are non threatening, open and collaborative.
              </p>  
              <p>
                The most typical form of EQ is active listening and reflections.  Now, some folks label this as “Conscious Listening” and I think that’s reasonable. I use “Active” because it describes my engagement with another person.  This is focusing on the speaker, looking at them and listening to what they say as they describe a situation and the context of how they felt within it.  I use active sounds of “hmm” “mmm hmm” as verbal punctuations so they understand that I’m paying attention but won’t interrupt them.  After a few minutes when the speaker gets to the end of their point and pauses, I may use phrases of reflection such as “From what you said, I heard…and you felt … Did I hear that right?”  Therefore inviting more conversation, clarification and connection (aka the 3 Cs).
              </p>           
              <p>
                As a UX designer, I use these skills professionally to engage people to gather information about something they know about. I use it when I’m testing a concept on a test participant. But mostly, I just use it to talk with folks and catch up with them.
              </p>               
              <p>
                Generationally, I heard the “EQ” label as a signal from young people to describe themselves or others when dealing with people.  They use phrases such as “So-n-so has a great EQ when it comes to difficult situations about …” or “My partner was having a hard day last night and I just “put on my EQ hat” and just listened to them.”  It feels a little situational in that context but I felt it was a way for them to say that “I use these skills to deal with overwhelming situations of adulthood with personal responsibility and empathy.”
              </p> 
              <p>
                And I appreciate that thoughtful approach, because I certainly didn’t understand these concepts when I was a young person starting out in the tech industry.  I’m not sure we actually had a word to describe this type of intelligence. But in the 21st century, exercising EQ skills feels normal for successful work and professional relationships.

            <summary>Is Figma Auto Layout the gate way drug to CSS Flexbox?
              <p class="date">
                27 June - 1 July 2022 / Sprint 2 / Tech
              </p> 
            </summary> <br>
            <h3>I fell down the rabbit hole</h3>
              <p>
                It's possible that I was thinking this part of the course would seem familiar to me. Because CSS is how the webpage looks and I may have dabbled in that in the past.  I traversed the lessons of watching the training videos and answering questions and it all seemed reasonable.  And then it got interesting with layouts with GRID.    
              </p>
              <p>
                It was then, when I fell down the Flexbox hole because I really enjoyed playing with the Flexbox. It reminded me of Figma Design tool which is a tool I use to design a webpage using the <strong>Auto Layout</strong> feature.  It felt familar to: 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>⚪ set areas on the page for header, main and footer.</li>
                <li>⚪ add content items for each area,</li>
                <li>⚪ use features of auto layout to decide how the items would flow on a page.</li>
              </ul>      
              <h3>Setting Direction</h3>
                <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-flex-gap.png" alt="Figma's Auto Layout">
                <p>
                  With Figma Auto Layout, I can set the direction of the items horizontally or vertically, just like flex-direction can be rows or column.  But Figma Auto Layout does not do the row-reverse or column reverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I can set the gap between items as well as padding horizontally and vertically. In Flexbox I've only managed to set gaps between items so far.
                </p>
              <h3>Alignment of items</h3>
                <p>
                  I find aligning items rather fundamental for layouts.
                </p>
                <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-flex-justify-content.png" alt="Jusify Content">
                <p>
                  With Figma Auto Layout, I can set the items alignment in 9 different ways.  With Flexbox, I use justify-content and align-items to specify how I want to put items in the space.  I do appreciate how easy it is to specify in Flexbox.
                </p>
              <h3>Advance Layout for spacing items</h3>
                <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-advanced-layout.png" alt="Packed">
                <img src="https://haunanipao.github.io/img/figma-auto-layout-advanced-layout-space-between.png" alt="Space Between">
                <p>
                  In Flexbox, there's quite a few options for setting item space.  You can use space-between, which give equal space between items on the page.  I found in Figma's Auto Layout, the options to set space between items or keep them packed closely.  Flexbox allows items to have space-around items, which I'm not sure I found something equal in Figma.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'll pick this up later as I have more time with Flexbox and making web pages.

              <h3>Hi, my name is Haunani Pao</h3>
              <p>
                Haunani is Hawaiian (ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi) which means "beautiful snow". <a href ="https://forvo.com/word/haunani/">Here's how you say it</a> My mother gave me this middle name because I was born in California in the northern hemisphere's wintertime. You can call me by my nickname, 'Nani', because it’s easier to remember and who doesn't like to be called 'beautiful' everyday? 😜
              </p>
              <p>
                I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and that has a huge impact on how I see the world and how I interact with people because I've always been surrounded by human diversity that categorises what it's like to be "American" as well as that tech world of ideas and art. I immigrated to Aotearoa in 2010 because I fell in love with a Kiwi man who ticks all the boxes for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Professionally I have worked in UX Design for the past 20 years (in both America and Aotearoa), however, most folks in the Auckland Tech Scene know me as the main organiser for UX Auckland and I can be found, most likely, talking with folks about the design work that impacts us on the daily as well as mentoring folks on their career journey.  Like many women in these Covid times, I was part of the 99% that “lost” their job which allowed me the privilege to take a break from “chasing the paycheck” and focusing on the stuff I’m interested in as a Researcher, Mentor, Freelance UX Designer, Curious Creator of Art, Gamer and Speaker.
              </p>                      
              <p>
                With that said, I’d like to leverage values that I crafted for UXA because they still hold true for my approach to life as an Amerikiwi woman who has made a home in a fabulous place on earth:
              </p>
              <h4>Kindness First!</h4>
                <p>
                  We call Aotearoa our home.  We’re Just Another Fabulous Accent. We think diverse points of view make for better outcomes.  We challenge our bias through warm and friendly conversations.   We value inclusivity, kindness and respect.
                </p>
                <h4>Be generous with your mana.</h4>
                <p>
                  We think everyone is smart and capable.  When two or more of us get together, we co-create and share learnings so "no one grows alone".
                </p> 
                <h4>Go HAM!</h4>
                <p>
                  We find the sparks of inspiration, explore and learn from mistakes. 
                  Go Hard Always Mate!
                </p> 
                <h3>So why am I doing Dev Academy?</h3>
                <p>
                  I’m so fortunate to have met and worked with Dev Academy Alumni. They inspired me to take this opportunity in the 👉🏽“I do what I want” world tour 👈🏽.  I’ve been spending the past few months researching and unpacking Blockchains, Crypto and NFTs and I want to learn how to code so I can see what ideas spring from my noggin but mostly improve my skills.  As my husband told me, “gain the skills to pay the bills”. My hope is that this will make me a better designer, but also open up work opportunities in the burgeoning blockchain domain.  Because they need folks like me.
                </p>
